# Variable Bindings and Expressions

Key Concepts:
* Dynamic Environment:
    - The environment we have while running the program.
* Static Environment:
    - Used for type checking.
    - Happens before program is run.
* Syntax vs. Semantics
    - Syntax is how your write something
    - Semantics is what the thing your write means
